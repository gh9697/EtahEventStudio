          <h3>My Story</h3>
          <p>
            My journey to becoming an artist began in 2012, when I started my
            freshman year at a charter film school. For four years, I attended
            G-Star School of The Arts, where my passions for photography and
            filmmaking were ignited. I remember sitting in my first film class,
            having never picked up a camera in my life, and a few days later, I
            made my first short film. I remember falling in love with the
            process of creating something with the camera.After I completed the
            project, my teacher came over to me and said: "hey, you got a good
            eye, kid. You should consider doing this as your profession. I think
            you've got a future in it". After hearing that, it clicked. From
            that point on, I decided that I wanted to do work with my camera for
            the rest of my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then, in the second week of school, emptied my bank account and
            bought my first camera. The first is to just keep shooting. I
            discovered that the more I shoot, the more I fail, and the more I
            fail, the more I learn. I have always lived by this notion ever
            since I started taking pictures. When I am shooting photos or
            creating art, I am myself, and without it, I feel like there is
            something missing from me. This past year, being a full-time college
            student taking 18 credits, a writer for Fstoppers, and running my
            own business, I still made time to do over 75 shoots, paid or
            unpaid, just to keep the creative fire burning.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned that you should never be complacent with your work and
            that you are only as good as your last shoot. Using this mentality,
            it has driven me to create work that I could never had imagined I
            would be doing and keeps me getting better consistently. If I had
            been satisfied with one award or great photo, my career would have
            ended in 2015.
