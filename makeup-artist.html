          <h3>My Story</h3>
          <p>
            My favourite teeny bopper magazine after graduating was a Bobbi
            Brown makeup guide. I read the book from cover to cover many times
            over and tried to re-create the looks.When things got serious and it
            became time to decide on my career choice and start working towards
            it seriously at uni level, upon my parents advice, I took the
            academic route. So off I went and enrolled on my degree to study
            Journalism. I managed to swing most of my stories around to a
            fashion or beauty angle and was quite happy plodding along learning
            more about the industry that my heart truly belonged to – the beauty
            industry. After three years, I graduated, and after much searching
            for a job in journalism, I didn’t have much luck. I was desperately
            unhappy – educated to degree level yet unemployed.

            I still kept dabbling in makeup and buying in products to write
            about on my blog which was now becoming a priority to me, and
            eventually, I enrolled on a short college course in Complete Makeup
            Artistry.I was struggling to keep up to my friends for social
            events, so when I was headhunted for a job that would allow me to
            use my journalism skills with a much more attractive wage packet, I
            took it on and moved away to Leeds.Although I worked in an office, I
            still dreamed of makeup and geared all of my content once again
            towards a fashion and beauty angle. I travelled home during weekends
            to make over clients for shoots at our family run studio, and to
            apply bridal makeups and special occasion makeups too. I also
            carefully crafted my skills with SFX makeup and started to get
            heavily into YouTube and lost in a world of beauty vloggers and
            makeup tutorials. Pixiwoo and Lisa Eldridge were some of my
            favourites (and I still adore them today).

            Today, makeup is my full time job. I get to do what I love every
            single day.To me, makeup is special. It helped me through dark days,
            it taught me to have fun again and more importantly, it taught me,
            even when you’ve had a bad day, you can take a look in the mirror,
            wipe it away and start a fresh again tomorrow.
