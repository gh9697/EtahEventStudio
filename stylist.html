          <h3>My Story</h3>
          <p>
            I am a hair stylist living in Detroit and I strive on furthering my
            hair education by attending as many classes on techniques as I
            possibly can. I've met a few stylists from Chicago and cities in
            Ohio at trade shows and I was (presently) surprised that Illinois
            and Ohio requires hair stylists to attend classes to maintain their
            licenses. I had never heard of that before.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Michigan, you don't need hours to keep your license - you simply
            pass the State Board and you never have to learn anything about hair
            again ~ if that's your choice. But that's not me. I love going to
            classes. If I just learn one little technique that can help me make
            more money or create the style better or quicker, then it's worth
            the time and money. Once I felt I didn't learn anything at a class,
            but I met someone there who is a genius in chemicals. We still keep
            in touch and she has taught me so much that I never learned in
            beauty school. So going to classes to network is extremely
            important, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            What really bothers me is when the other stylists in the salon I
            work at talk about how "great" they are and how they don't have to
            go to classes. But every time I bring back new techniques and
            knowledge, they're all around me, asking me all these questions and
            they want me to show them everything I learned. I'm like, "you
            better take your ass to the class" and don't keep giving me that sad
            puppy dog-like look - hey, we're like doctors in the hair game. We
            all need to learn all we can about hair and hair products. Don't get
            left behind, because I'm movin' ahead.
